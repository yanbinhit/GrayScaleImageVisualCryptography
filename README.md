Improving the Visual Quality of Visual Cryptography for Grayscale Image

## Usage:
1. Excute RunMeFirst.m to add path to Matlab
2. The AbS-based probabilistic VC and vector VC can be found in subfolder 'basicVcs'
3. Batch testing can be found in subfolder 'plots'
4. The metrics that are used to characterize gray scale image VCs can be found in 'metrics'
